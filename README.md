# Lesson 2.1 PCA
## Creating a Login Name

Different institutions have different ways of creating login names (usernames). Consider a school that creates theirs by combining:
* the first 2 characters of the student's first name
* the first 2 characters of the student's last name
* the last 2 digits of the student's expected graduation year

For example, Alicia Romero, class of 2025, would be `AlRo25`. 

Write a program that prompts the user for each value and then creates and prints their username. Use [my_code.py](src/my_code.py) to write and run your program.

Hints:
* Note the capitalization - prompt the user to enter their names with the first letter capitalized. (You will learn how to change lowercase to upper and vice versa in the lext lesson.)
* Be sure to have the user enter all 4 digits of their graduation year
* You will need to use slicing to get the letters and numbers and then concatenate them to create the username

### Submitting your Repo
* When you have finished testing your program, commit and push to GitHub.
* Go to the repo on GitHub and click on the Pull Requests tab. Look for feedback about code function and style. If any issues are found, fix them and check your changes in to GitHub. repeat until no errors are found.
* When done, submit "Done" on Canvas.
